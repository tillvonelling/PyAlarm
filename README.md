# PyAlarm
Simple cross-platform Python alarm clock

PyAlarm is my first attempt at producing something useful in Python and as such (so far) is very crude and buggy.
I definitely do not recommend anyone to actually use it at this point. I use it anyway, and so far it gets the job done. Mostly.

The Tkinter GUI is desinged to fit on the official 7" multitouch display for the Raspberry Pi.

Dependencies<br>
Python 3.x (tested with 3.5) standard library<br>
VLC Media Player for playing the alarm sound
Some web browser for viewing the license from within the aplication
